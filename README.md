# films-oscar-analysis

**Objective:** Analyse the differences between Oscar awarded and non-awarded films.

**Structure:** The project is divided into two parts:
  **1-Wrangling:** The first part consists of a gathering of all the data into a unique dataset and the parse of all features into      cuantitative values.
  **2-Analysis:** The second part is the analysis itself. It goes from the application of basic techniques to understand the data to more complex techniques such as dimensionality reduction or clustering.
  
**Data:** The data is obtained from Kaggle:
